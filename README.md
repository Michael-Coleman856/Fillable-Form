<h1>Word Form Redesign — Plain Document to Fillable Form</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

- What the form is for
- What the goal was
- What you improved
  
This project demonstrates how I redesigned a plain Word document into a structured, fillable form. The updated version improves readability, adds clear sections, and introduces fillable fields to reduce user errors and support consistent data collection.
