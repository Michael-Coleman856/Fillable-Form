<h1>Word Form Redesign — Plain Document to Fillable Form</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

- What the form is for
- What the goal was
- What you improved
  
This project demonstrates how I redesigned a plain Word document into a structured, fillable form. The updated version improves readability, adds clear sections, and introduces fillable fields to reduce user errors and support consistent data collection.

<h2>What Was Wrong With the Original</h2>

- No clear section structure or visual hierarchy
- Hard to scan quickly due to dense layout
- Inconsistent spacing, alignment, and field placement
- Not fillable (users had to type freely with no guidance)
- Increased risk of missing required information or entering inconsistent data
- Limited error prevention (no required fields, dropdowns, or validation)

<h2>✅ Updated Form Summary (After)</h2>

This redesigned version improves the original Cookie Order Form by converting it into a structured, fillable document with clear input areas. The updated layout improves usability by guiding the user on exactly where to enter information, reducing the chance of incomplete submissions.
